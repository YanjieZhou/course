## Course description

Computational Social Science (CSS) combines the theoretical paradigms of the social sciences with the expanded data and computational methods of computer science. Massive digital traces of human behavior and ubiquitous computation have both extended and altered classical social science inquiry. This course surveys successful social science applications of computational approaches to the representation of complex data, information visualization, and model construction and estimation. We will examine the scientific method in the social sciences in context of both theory development and testing, exploring how computation and digital data enables new answers to classic investigations, the posing of novel questions, and new ethical challenges and opportunities. Students will review fundamental research designs such as observational studies and experiments, statistical summaries, visualization of data, and how computational opportunities can enhance them. The focus of the course is on exploring the wide range of contemporary approaches to computational social science, with problem sets, programming exercises, and written assignments to gain experience with these methods.

### Learning objectives

* Introduce major research paradigms in computational social science
* Read and critique recent seminal papers
* Develop an original research topic
* Implement exploratory methods for analyzing data

## Required textbooks

> All textbooks are available in electronic editions either directly from the author or via the UChicago library (authentication required). Hardcopies can be purchased at your preferred retailer.

* [Booth, Wayne et al., *The Craft of Research*, 4th ed. University of Chicago Press, 2016.](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/uchicago/detail.action?docID=4785166)
* [Salganik, Matthew J., *Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age*, Princeton University Press, 2018.](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/)

## Evaluation

Grades will be based on your performance on eight assignments, each of which is worth 10 points with the exception of the research proposal. Some of these will be writing assignments. Some of these will be computational exercises.

* You must submit your assignments by creating a copy of the homework repository using the provided GitHub Classroom link. All contents must be committed and pushed to this repo by the assignment deadline.
* Assignments will be given on the day listed in the course schedule below. In general, assignments will be due before class at 11:30am a week after they are assigned. However, exact due dates and times will be listed on the assignment.

### Plagiarism on writing assignments

The TAs will hold a Wednesday night lab to discuss what constitutes plagiarism and how to avoid it. Academic honesty is an extremely important principle in academia and at the University of Chicago.

* Writing assignments must put in quotes and cite any excerpts taken from another work.
* If the cited work is the particular paper referenced in the Assignment, no works cited or references are necessary at the end of the composition.
* If the cited work is not the particular paper referenced in the Assignment, you MUST include a works cited or references section at the end of the composition.
* Any copying of other students' work will result in a zero grade and potential further academic discipline.

### Late Problem Sets

Unexcused late problem sets will be penalized 1 points for every hour they are late. For example, if an assignment is due on Monday at 11:30am, the following points will be deducted based on the time stamp of the last commit.

| Example PR last commit | points deducted |
| ---------------------- | --------------- |
| 11:31am to 12:30pm     | -1 points       |
| 12:31pm to 1:30pm      | -2 points       |
| 1:31pm to 2:30pm       | -3 points       |
| 2:31pm to 3:30pm       | -4 points       |
| ...                    | ...             |
| 8:31pm and beyond      | -10 points (no credit) |

## Statement on Disabilities

The University of Chicago is committed to diversity and rigorous inquiry from multiple perspectives. The MAPSS, CIR, and Computation programs share this commitment and seek to foster productive learning environments based upon inclusion, open communication, and mutual respect for a diverse range of identities, experiences, and positions.

This course is open to all students who meet the academic requirements for participation. Any student who has a documented need for accommodation should contact Student Disability Services (773-702-6000 or [disabilities@uchicago.edu](mailto:disabilities@uchicago.edu)) and provide the instructor of their section (Dr. Soltoff or Dr. Clindaniel) with a copy of your Accommodation Determination Letter as soon as possible.
